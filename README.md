# 🌱 Sust-Enablers — Carbon Analytics & Sustainable Investment Platform

---

## 🧭 Overview
**Sust-Enablers** is a data-driven platform designed to support impact-driven funds and ESG-oriented investors.  
It integrates carbon analytics, financial modelling, and carbon-credit trading simulations to help asset managers  
quantify emissions, assess regulatory compliance, and identify new opportunities for sustainable investment.  

The platform leverages Python’s open-source ecosystem (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) to translate carbon and financial  
data into actionable intelligence — bridging the gap between environmental performance and financial profitability.

## 🧠 Methodology
The analysis follows four main steps:
1. **Data Collection and Integration** — sourcing sustainability and financial data from public disclosures and datasets.  
2. **Emission Estimation Model** — estimating missing data using energy consumption and emission factors.  
3. **Benchmarking & Threshold Analysis** — comparing firm performance against sectoral or regulatory targets.  
4. **Carbon Credit Trading Simulation** — quantifying the financial impact of emission surpluses and deficits.

## 📈 Outputs
The simulation provides:
- Carbon emission intensities and their deviation from target thresholds.  
- Financial exposure to carbon-credit markets.  
- Trading insights for firms positioned as net buyers or sellers of carbon credits.  
- Visual representations of intensity vs. revenue, cost/revenue breakdowns, and net trading positions.

## 💡 Key Takeaway
Sust-Enablers demonstrates how sustainability data can evolve from a compliance tool  
into a **strategic driver of investment performance and portfolio optimization**.  
It quantifies the tangible financial value of decarbonisation and helps investors  
align profitability with measurable environmental impact.
